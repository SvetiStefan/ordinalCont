\title{Inverse of generalized logistic g function}
\usage{
g_glf_inv(W, par)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{vector of scores on the latent scale \eqn{(-\infty,\infty)}. M, the
offset of the g function, is
estimated as the intercept of the model.
\deqn{W=-x'\beta [without intercept] = -x'\beta - M} [as the model is
estimated with an intercept].}

\item{par}{vector of 2 elements: B, the slope of the curve, and T, the symmetry
of the curve.}
}
\value{
A vector of length equal to the length of W, with values \eqn{g^{-1}(W)}
}
\description{
This function computes the inverse of a parametric version of the g function
following Richards (1959):
\deqn{g^{-1}(W) = \left( \frac{e^{BW}}{T+e^{BW}}  \right)^{\frac{1}{T}}} M is omitted
as it is absorbed into the
model intercept.
