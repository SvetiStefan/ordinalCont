\title{Inverse of generalized logistic g function}
\usage{
g_glf_inv(W, par)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{Vector of scores on the latent scale \eqn{(-\infty,\infty)}. M, the
offset of the g function, is
estimated as the intercept of the model.
\deqn{W=-x'\beta [without intercept] = -x'\beta - M} [as the model is
estimated with an intercept].}

\item{par}{vector of 2 elements: B, the slope of the curve, and T, the symmetry
of the curve.}
}
\description{
This function computes the inverse of a parametric version of the g function
following Richards (1959):
\deqn{g(v) = M + \frac{1}{B} log\left(\frac{Tv^T}{1-v^T}\right)} M is omitted
as it is absorbed into the
model intercept.
