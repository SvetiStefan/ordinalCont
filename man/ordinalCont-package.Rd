Ordinal regression analysis is a convenient tool for analyzing ordinal response variables
in the presence of covariates. We extend this methodology to the case of continuous self-rating
scales such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) used in pain assessment, or the Linear Analog
Self-Assessment (LASA) scales in quality of life studies. Subjects are
typically given a linear scale of 100 mm and asked to put a mark where they perceive
themselves. These scales  measure subjects'
perception of an intangible quantity, and cannot be handled as ratio variables because of their
inherent nonlinearity.  We express  the likelihood in terms of a function (the ``g function'')
 connecting the
scale with an underlying continuous latent  variable. In the current version the g function
is taken as
the generalized logistic function (Richards 1959). This has 3 parameters:
\code{M}, the offset, \code{B}, the slope, and \code{T}, the symmetry of the curve.
The link function is the inverse of the CDF of the assumed underlying distribution of the
latent variable. Currently
the logit link, which corresponds to a standard logistic distribution, is implemented.
(This implies a proportional odds model.)
