\details{
A dataset containing the VAS scores in a clinical trial for the effectiveness
of laser treatment for chronic neck pain. Patients (n=84) were randomly assigned to receive
either active laser treatment or placebo. VAS scores were recorded by the patients
 at three time points: baseline,
the end of the course of treatment and one month after completion of the treatment.

The variables are as follows:
\tabular{rlll}{
 \tab \bold{Name}\tab \bold{Type}\tab \bold{Description}\cr
   \tab time\tab numeric\tab  time  at which the VAS score is recorded: 1=baseline; 2=end of treatment; \cr

  \tab sex\tab binary\tab 1=male; 2=female\cr
