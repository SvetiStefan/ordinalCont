Description: Ordinal regression analysis is a convenient tool for analyzing ordinal response variables in the presence of covariates. We express  the likelihood in terms of a function (the g function) connecting the scale with an underlying continuous latent  variable. In the current version the g function is taken as the generalized logistic function (Richards 1959). This has 3 parameters: M, the offset, B, the slope, and T, the symmetry of the curve. The link function is the inverse of the CDF of the assumed underlying distribution of the latent variable. Currently the logit link, which corresponds to a standard logistic distribution, is implemented. (This implies a proportional odds model.)
